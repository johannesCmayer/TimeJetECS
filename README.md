# TimeJet
I explored how to use the Unity ECS. I ended up with a very basic prototype where you can fly around in a spaceship, where the time goes faster according to how much you use your thrusters, while your positional and rotational velocities independent of this time distortion. (I.e. you can give a brief thrust and rotate and then stop using your thrust to continue rotating but freezing the enemies.)

I have also implemented the [Winkel tripel projection](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Winkel_tripel_projection) in a shader, to create a 360-degree camera by studying the source code of [Blinky](https://github.com/shaunlebron/blinky).

I developed this in 5 days or so in 2019.

All of the art assets are from the Unity asset store.
